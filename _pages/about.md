About Me
======

I am Limengzi Yuan, a passionate educator and researcher in the field of Computer Science and Technology. After completing my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Tianjin University, I was honored with the title of "Outstanding Graduate" and awarded a National Scholarship for Postgraduates. My academic journey and professional experience have equipped me with a strong foundation in dynamic network analysis, deep learning, and computational intelligence.

Currently, I am serving as a lecturer at Shihezi University, where I teach a variety of undergraduate courses, including Algorithm Analysis and Design, Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Engineering Ethics. I am deeply involved in course development, including the creation of quizzes, exams, and homework, as well as revising syllabi to meet accreditation standards.

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of network reliability, deep learning, and community detection in complex systems. I have worked on developing deep learning-based models to improve traffic network reliability and optimize system performance. Additionally, I have explored innovative algorithms for community detection in temporal networks, with applications in social networks, forest monitoring systems, and ocean technology. My research contributions have been published in prestigious journals, including *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*.

I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, and I have received numerous accolades throughout my academic career, including the "Most Beautiful Teachers" Award. I am dedicated to advancing the field of computer science, with a focus on AI applications in real-world problems and the optimization of complex network systems.
