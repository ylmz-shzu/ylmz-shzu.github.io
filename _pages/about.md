About Me
======

I am Limengzi Yuan, a researcher and lecturer specializing in Computer Science and Technology. I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Tianjin University, where I was honored with the "Outstanding Graduate" title and received the National Scholarship.

Currently, I serve as a lecturer at Shihezi University, teaching courses such as Algorithm Analysis and Design, Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Engineering Ethics. 

My research primarily focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in object detection and data analysis, particularly from complex datasets and large-scale network environments. Additionally, I have published research in various other areas, with a focus on community detection, deep learning techniques, and traffic network analysis.

I am proficient in programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python, and am fluent in English. My achievements have been recognized through various teaching awards, including the "Most Beautiful Teacher" Award. My dedication to advancing both research and education drives me to continue exploring the intersections of technology, education, and sustainability.

Feel free to connect or reach me.
