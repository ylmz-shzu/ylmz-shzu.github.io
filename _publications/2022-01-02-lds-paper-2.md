This paper introduces LDS-YOLO, a novel lightweight small object detection method for detecting dead trees in shelter forests. By enhancing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework, LDS-YOLO improves both the accuracy and efficiency of small object detection, making it more suitable for monitoring forest health and preventing ecological degradation in large-scale forest areas.
