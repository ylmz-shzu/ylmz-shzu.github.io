TCDA-NE, a novel TCD algorithm that combines evolutionary clustering with convex non-negative matrix factorization (Convex-NMF). Our method innovatively integrates community structure into network embedding, preserving both microscopic details and community-level information in node representations while effectively capturing the evolutionary dynamics of networks.
