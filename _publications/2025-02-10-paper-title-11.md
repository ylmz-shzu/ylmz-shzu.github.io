In this article, we propose DomFuzz, a dominator-based directed grey-box fuzzing method that enables precise vulnerability distance calculations for critical infrastructure components. Specifically, to fairly distribute computing resources to testing inputs, we use a dominator-based power schedule for the first time.Additionally, we adjust the transition time between testing phases dynamically to improve vulnerability identification efficiency in ICPSs.
