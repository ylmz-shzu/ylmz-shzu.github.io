This paper introduces a method for tracking and detecting dynamic communities in temporal networks with a focus on preserving node popularity. The proposed approach captures the evolution of communities over time, ensuring that influential nodes retain their importance, which significantly enhances the detection of dynamic structures in large-scale networks.
