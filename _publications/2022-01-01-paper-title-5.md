This paper introduces DCNMF, a dynamic community discovery method that leverages an improved convex nonnegative matrix factorization (Convex-NMF) approach to detect communities in temporal networks. The method effectively captures the temporal evolution of communities, providing enhanced performance in discovering dynamic network structures over time.
