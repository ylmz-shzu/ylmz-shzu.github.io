This paper introduces a community detection method for temporal networks based on triple nonnegative matrix factorization (Triple-NMF). By incorporating multiple levels of nonnegative matrix factorization, the approach captures both temporal and structural information, enhancing the detection of evolving communities in dynamic networks.
