This paper introduces the Temporal Smoothness Framework, designed to analyze and explore the evolutionary transition behavior within dynamic networks. By examining the temporal smoothness of network evolution, the framework provides insights into the patterns and processes of dynamic system behavior, offering a deeper understanding of the structural transitions in complex networks.
