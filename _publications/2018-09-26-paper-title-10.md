This paper introduces an efficient critical incident propagation model for social networks that incorporates trust factors. By considering the trust relationships between individuals in the network, the model aims to accurately predict the propagation of critical incidents and improve decision-making processes in social network management. The proposed approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of incident detection and response in large-scale social networks.
